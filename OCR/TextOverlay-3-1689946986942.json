For personal current accounts (excluding Premier\nand Jade by HSBC Premier) overdraft interest is only charged\non arranged overdrawn balances. Debit interest is calculated\ndaily on the cleared debit balance of your account, it accrues\nduring your charging cycle (usually monthly) and is deducted\nfrom your account following the end of your charging cycle.\nEffective from 1 August 2017\nMonthly cap on unarranged overdraft charges\n1. Each current account will set a monthly maximum\ncharge for:\n(a) going overdrawn when you have not arranged an\noverdraft; or\n(b) going over/past your arranged overdraft limit (if you\nhave one).\n2. This cap covers any:\n(a) interest and fees for going over/past your arranged\noverdraft limit;\n(b) fees for each payment your bank allows despite lack\nof funds; and\n(c) fees for each payment your bank refuses due to lack\nof funds.\nThe monthly cap on unarranged overdraft charges for\nthe Bank Account, Current Account, Home Management\nAccount, HSBC Advance Bank Account and Graduate Bank\nAccount is £80.\nThe monthly cap on unarranged overdraft charges is not\napplicable to Bank Account Pay Monthly, Basic Bank\nAccount, Student Bank Account, Amanah Bank Account\nand MyAccount as these accounts do not incur unarranged\noverdraft charges.\nThe introduction of the Monthly Maximum Charge will not\naffect any charging period that ended prior to 1st August 2017.\nAny notification of charges that are generated on or after\n1st August 2017 will incorporate the new Monthly Maximum\nCharge cap.\nThe following references regarding debit cards only\napply to personal customers, commercial customers\nplease refer to your terms and conditions.\nYour debit card\nWhen you use your card abroad, your statement will show\nwhere the transaction took place, the amount spent in local\ncurrency and the amount converted into sterling. We also\nmonitor transactions to protect you against your card being\nused fraudulently.\nUnless you agree that the currency conversion is done at the\npoint of sale or withdrawal and agree the rate at that time, for\nexample with the shopkeeper or on the self-service machine\nscreen, the exchange rate that applies to any non-sterling\ndebit card payments (including cash withdrawals) is the VISA\nPayment Scheme Exchange Rate applying on the day the\nconversion Is made.\nFor non-Sterling (foreign currency) transactions we will charge\na fee of 2.75% of the amount of the transaction. This fee will\nbe shown as a separate line on your statement as a 'Non-\nSterling Transaction Fee'.\nHSBC UK Bank plc\nRegistered in England and Wales with registration number 09928412\nRegistered office: 1 Centenary Square, Birmingham B1 1HQ,\nUnited Kingdom\nRFB1898 MCP50300 07/18 © HSBC Group 2018\nDetails of the current VISA Payment Scheme Exchange Rates\ncan be obtained from the card support section of hsbc.co.uk\n(UK customers) or ciom.hsbc.com (Channel Islands and Isle\nof Man customers) or by calling us on the usual numbers.\nWe will deduct the payment from your account once we\nreceive details of the payment from the card scheme, at the\nlatest, the next working day.\nFor cash machine withdrawals in a currency other than\nsterling we will charge a Non Sterling Cash Fee of 2%\n(minimum £1.75, maximum £5).

HSBC\nAdvance customers are exempt from this fee.\nSome cash machine operators may apply a direct charge for\nwithdrawals from their cash machines and this will be advised\non screen at the time of withdrawal.\nRecurring Transaction\nA recurring transaction, sometimes called a continuous\npayment authority, is a series of payments collected with\nyour agreement from your card by a retailer or supplier (for\nexample, insurance cover). This is an agreement between\nyou and the retailer. The Direct Debit Guarantee does not\ncover these transactions. If you wish to cancel a recurring\ntransaction you can do this with the retailer or us. We can\ncancel the payment, however contacting the retailer allows\nyou to also deal with the agreement you have with them\nand you can make other arrangements for the payment or\ncancellation of the goods or services. If you cancel with\nthe retailer, we recommend you keep evidence of the\ncancellation. Once you have cancelled with the retailer or us,\nif the retailer does try to collect any future payments under\nthe recurring transaction agreement, we will treat these as\nunauthorised.
